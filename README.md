Text file of all my goof off ideas so I can put them somewhere and not think about them until I have time

### Ideas
- A weight scale to measure the syrup levels of the coke machine one the 2nd floor lobby
-- A monitor to alert when levels are low
-- Will need acccess to wifi, a scale, an arduino a button, a bread board
